Situationally Aware AI Wallet

The Situationally Aware Wallet is a keystone of the Current-See system. More than a digital payment tool, it's a decision-making assistant.

Key Features:
- Tracks daily Solar balance and accumulates undistributed surplus
- Calculates the real energy footprint of potential purchases (e.g. food, clothes, electronics)
- Guides users toward lower-carbon alternatives and provides contextual nudges
- Integrates voice, image, and location inputs for multimodal interaction
- Offers merchants a tool to align pricing with energy content

The wallet is capable of showing the user how much solar energy was embodied in the product or service they are evaluating. This creates a pricing system tied not to fiat, but to energy realism.

Eventually, the AI wallet will serve as the universal key to participating in the TC-S economy and tracking personal energy ethics.
