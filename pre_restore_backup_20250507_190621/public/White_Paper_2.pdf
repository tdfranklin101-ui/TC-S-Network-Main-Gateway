The Current-See Solution and Technology Stack

This document outlines the full system architecture behind The Current-See platform, a technical bridge between planetary energy flows and individual wealth creation. The solution stack includes four primary layers:

1. Solar Input and Measurement (IoT Layer)
Smart sensors and data aggregation nodes measure daily solar irradiance. These are placed globally, drawing from satellite data and ground-based solar farms. This layer ensures transparency and precision in calculating the total kWh available for monetization.

2. Token Generation and Issuance (Blockchain + Algorithmic Layer)
The system monetizes 1% of Earth's daily solar income and converts it to the "Solar" token. A smart contract calculates the per capita issuance rate based on the global population and algorithmic adjustments that fund reserves, operations, and scalability.

3. Wallet Interface and Distribution (AI Wallet Layer)
Solar tokens are distributed daily to each network participant through a situationally aware AI wallet. It prices goods and services based on energy input and supports responsible, informed transactions.

4. The TC-S Network (Protocol Layer)
The TC-S Network is the decentralized system that ensures trustless operation, consensus validation, and open integration with developers and commercial systems. Every transaction is verified against energy equivalency.

Together, these layers establish an open, auditable, and secure platform for implementing energy-backed basic income and a new planetary economy.
