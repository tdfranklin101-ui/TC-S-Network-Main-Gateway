  <h1>How the TC-S Network Will Power Civilization</h1>

  <p>
    The TC-S Network is not a platform. It is a protocol for purpose. A planetary system where each person receives <strong>1 Solar token per day</strong>, representing <strong>4,913 kWh</strong> of real-world value. This is not currency. This is <em>directional energy</em>—a signal of what you care about, encoded in thermodynamics.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Foundation + PBC Structure</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>TC-S Foundation</strong> holds the Solar Generator, issues the daily dividend, and safeguards human rights encoded in the energy ledger.
    The <strong>TC-S Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)</strong> hosts the digital marketplace, manages user interfaces, and facilitates exchange of goods, services, and compute direction.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Computronium: Directing Intelligence</h2>
  <p>
    Users stake their Solar tokens to vote for categories of purpose: health, climate, longevity, open knowledge, and more. These tokens are routed to computational infrastructure—local clusters or public models—to execute AI aligned with collective values.
  </p>

  <p>
    This transforms Solar into what we call <strong>Computronium</strong>: the most optimized use of energy as intentional intelligence.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Transparency + Civic Feedback</h2>
  <p>
    All token flow, compute allocation, and model results are transparently published in real time. A civic dashboard lets every user see:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Where their Solar was directed</li>
    <li>What models were trained</li>
    <li>How outcomes are used in the real world</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. A Post-Fiat Civilizational Model</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of speculative currency, this system builds a <em>real economy backed by physics</em>. The sun powers the network. The people power the sun. Together, we shift from scarcity games to regenerative abundance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every wallet is a vote. Every Solar is a seed. The Foundation stewards the protocol. The PBC evolves the tools. And the future listens.
