          <p><strong style="color:#00d4b4;">Nostalgia remembers the comfort, not the cost.</strong><br>
          We look back and see community, simplicity, familiar rhythms — but not the darkness at the edge of that light.
          The comfort of the past was never free. It was built on harder lives, shorter lifespans, and narrow opportunities.
          What feels like loss when we compare eras is often just the fading of selective memory.</p>

          <p><strong style="color:#00d4b4;">They dreamed of surviving. We dream of thriving.</strong><br>
          The people of yesterday fought disease, hunger, and inequality with what little they had — and still managed to create art, laughter, and love.
          Survival was victory. Their work gave us the foundation for a world where thriving is even imaginable.
          Progress is not arrogance; it is inheritance.</p>

          <p><strong style="color:#00d4b4;">Abundance is not arrogance — it’s gratitude to those who came before.</strong><br>
          We stand on shoulders that ache from carrying civilization forward.
          Our abundance — of health, energy, and knowledge — is their gift to us.
          To honor them is to use that abundance wisely, to turn comfort into compassion, and innovation into inclusion.</p>

          <p><strong style="color:#00d4b4;">The best time to be alive is now. And the best time after that will be tomorrow.</strong><br>
          Each generation believes it lives at history’s edge — and it’s true. Every age is the frontier of what’s possible.
          The present is not perfect, but it is the most humane, connected, and abundant moment in human history.
          And if we keep choosing empathy and imagination over fear and nostalgia, tomorrow will be better still.</p>
