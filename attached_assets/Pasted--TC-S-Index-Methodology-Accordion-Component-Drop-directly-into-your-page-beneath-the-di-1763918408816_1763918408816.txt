      title: "Solar Index (SI)",
      content: `
Solar Index measures global renewable energy abundance, stability, and efficiency.

Formula:
SI = 0.40*(Global Renewable Penetration) 
   + 0.30*(Energy Storage Stability) 
   + 0.30*(Grid Efficiency Ratio)

Inputs:
• Global daylight generation vs dark-cycle deficit  
• Storage / battery reserve levels  
• Transmission efficiency + losses  
• Normalized to a 0–100 scale

Purpose:
Baseline health of humanity’s solar-energy future.
      `
    },
    {
      title: "Solar Reserve Health",
      content: `
Measures the stability, coverage, and fulfillment rate of the TC-S Solar Reserve.

Formula:
Reserve Health = (Current Reserve / Required Reserve) × Fulfillment Factor

Inputs:
• Global solar generator ledger from 2025–present  
• Daily Solar → kWh equivalency  
• Redemption load vs reserve remaining  

Purpose:
Shows whether global Solar distribution can remain stable long-term.
      `
    },
    {
      title: "Global Basic Income (GBI)",
      content: `
Measures the percentage of humans who can actively receive daily Solar.

Formula:
GBI = (Active Solar Claimants ÷ Total Humans) × 100

Assumptions:
• Smartphone penetration (2025): ~67%  
• Digital identity penetration: ~62%  
• Activation rate estimate: 70%  

Example:
3.5B active users ÷ 8.15B humans ≈ 42.9%

Purpose:
Represents global digital readiness for Solar-based income.
      `
    },
    {
      title: "Compute Alignment",
      content: `
Measures ethical compute allocation across AI and automated systems.

Formula:
Compute Alignment = (Aligned Compute Flow ÷ Total Compute Flow) × 100

Inputs:
• UIM Protocol alignment checks  
• Ethics Engine accept/reject ratios  
• Priority weighting for human-beneficial compute  

Purpose:
Shows how safely humanity’s compute infrastructure is trending.
      `
    },
    {
      title: "Market Liquidity",
      content: `
Measures health and velocity of TC-S digital market activity.

Formula:
Liquidity = (Token Velocity × Transaction Depth × Participant Spread)

Inputs:
• Marketplace activity  
• Number of active wallets  
• Volume of Solar Rays spent per 24h  
• Listing-to-sale ratio  

Purpose:
Indicates digital economic flow strength.
      `
    },
    {
      title: "Ethical Alignment",
      content: `
Measures acceptance ratio of actions evaluated by the Ethics Engine.

Formula:
Ethical Alignment = (Approved Ethical Actions ÷ Total Evaluated Actions) × 100

Inputs:
• Ethics Engine decisions  
• Safety filter evaluations  
• Human-rights compliance factors  

Purpose:
Represents global ethical stability of automated decision systems.
