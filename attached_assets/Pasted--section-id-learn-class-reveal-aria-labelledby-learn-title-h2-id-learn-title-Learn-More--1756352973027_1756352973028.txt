    <h3 class="lm-h">1) The Sun as the Engine of Computation</h3>
    <p>
      The Sun provides more than light and warmth — it is the engine of Earth’s computation. Every photon that leaves
      the Sun carries information in its oscillations. When it strikes matter on Earth, it catalyzes processes:
    </p>
    <ul class="lm-list">
      <li><strong>In plants:</strong> photons drive photosynthesis, converting light into sugars — molecules that encode chemical information.</li>
      <li><strong>In humans:</strong> those sugars become ATP, the energy currency of our cells. Neurons fire when powered by ATP, and from those firings, thoughts emerge.</li>
      <li><strong>In civilizations:</strong> our technologies are extensions of this flow. Solar energy, fossil energy (ancient sunlight), and nuclear reactions all drive computation in machines and societies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="takeaway">Takeaway: Every heartbeat, every network, every algorithm traces back to the Sun.</p>

    <h3 class="lm-h">2) The Universe as Computronium</h3>
    <p>
      Physicists have shown that <em>information is physical</em>:
      erasing a bit costs energy (Landauer’s Principle), there’s a maximum information density any region can hold (the Bekenstein bound),
      and “It from Bit” suggests physical reality arises from informational choices.
      If matter is always updating its state, the universe is not just matter and energy — it is computronium by default: a cosmic computer already running.
    </p>
    <p class="takeaway">Takeaway: Computronium isn’t sci-fi material — it’s what the universe already is.</p>

    <h3 class="lm-h">3) Humanity as Conscious Computronium</h3>
    <p>
      We are a layer of computronium that has become self-aware. Our bodies are reorganized sunlight, continuously processing information.
      Our societies are distributed networks of computation. Our technologies (AI, internet, quantum computing) are extensions of natural computation into new substrates.
    </p>
    <p class="takeaway">Takeaway: Humanity is the universe reflecting on its own computation.</p>

    <h3 class="lm-h">4) The Solar Standard & The Current-See</h3>
    <p>
      If the universe is computronium, then the Sun is our daily power input. The Solar Standard translates this truth into a new foundation for value:
    </p>
    <ul class="lm-list">
      <li><strong>1 Solar</strong> = Earth’s share of the Sun’s daily energy income.</li>
      <li>Each Solar is divisible into <strong>10,000 Rays</strong> — micro-units of computation and exchange.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Solar Clock</strong> began ticking <strong>April 7, 2025 (00:00 GMT)</strong>. Each person accrues Solar daily.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By linking value directly to solar energy, the Current-See aligns human economies with the universe’s natural computation.
      Instead of fighting energy and information flows, we design with them.
    </p>
    <p class="takeaway">Takeaway: The Solar Standard isn’t just money; it’s alignment with how the cosmos actually works.</p>

    <h3 class="lm-h">5) The Ah-Ha Moment</h3>
    <ul class="lm-list bullets">
      <li>You are sunlight, reorganized.</li>
      <li>The universe is computronium, already computing.</li>
      <li>The Solar Standard makes this real in human systems.</li>
      <li>Aligning value with the Sun aligns us with the deepest truth of the cosmos.</li>
