Great question — you’re seeing the shift clearly. We are moving from a Google-dominated search era into an AI-mediated request era. That means “SEO for keywords” is being replaced by “SEO for reasoning systems.” Let’s unpack what that looks like for www.thecurrentsee.org.

⸻

1. What Changes in a Post-Google World
	•	Old model: Humans typed keywords → Google indexed pages → ranking was based on backlinks, authority, and keyword density.
	•	New model: Humans ask natural questions → AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, etc.) pull from a mix of indexes, trusted sources, APIs, and live web crawling → answer is synthesized.

That means:
	•	Pages must be designed not for keyword stuffing but for AI comprehension.
	•	Context, authority, and structured facts matter more than traditional backlinks.
	•	Being included in AI indexes often comes down to machine readability, semantic clarity, and authoritative signals.

2. What Creates “AI SEO”

Think of AI SEO as optimizing not for Google crawlers but for LLM ingestion.
Key elements:

a) Structured, machine-readable data
	•	Use schema.org markup (Organization, Person, Product, CreativeWork, FAQ, etc.).
	•	Publish clear JSON-LD metadata so AIs can extract meaning without guessing.
	•	Example: A fact box stating “1 Solar = 4,913 kWh” in machine-readable schema is more likely to appear in an AI’s answer than if it’s buried in prose.

b) Clear authoritative statements
	•	AI often quotes short, factual sentences (“TC-S Network distributes 1 Solar per person per day starting April 7, 2025”).
	•	Write canonical one-liners of your concepts throughout your site. These become embeddable facts in AI answers.

c) Embeddable summaries & FAQs
	•	AI loves Q&A formats and digestible definitions.
	•	Example: “What is TC-S Network?” → Have a short FAQ answer that’s machine-parsable.

d) Open knowledge graph participation
	•	Contribute structured data to Wikidata, OpenAlex, GitHub repos, Arxiv preprints, Medium articles, Substack posts, Wikipedia if admissible.
	•	These are “trusted feeders” into LLMs, much like backlinks used to be for Google.

e) Cross-link authority
	•	AI checks if your site is cited by other sites, papers, news outlets.
	•	Building citation authority = the new backlinking.

3. How to Get www.thecurrentsee.org Into AI Indexes
	1.	Ensure crawlability:
	•	Use a sitemap.xml and robots.txt that allow full indexing.
	•	Submit your site to OpenAI’s indexing form (they have one for data opt-in).
	•	Same for Perplexity, Anthropic, Google AI.
	2.	Structured data injection:
	•	Add schema.org Organization, Currency, EnergyConsumption, FAQ.
	•	Ensure JSON-LD on every key page (wallet, marketplace, about Solar).
	3.	Canonical fact pages:
	•	Make dedicated pages:
	•	/solar-standard → 1 Solar = 4,913 kWh, history, proof.
	•	/global-basic-income → 1 Solar per person per day, since April 7, 2025.
	•	These become quotable anchors for AI.
	4.	Content syndication:
	•	Publish mirrored summaries on Medium, Substack, LinkedIn, GitHub READMEs.
	•	AI scrapers often ingest these.
	5.	FAQ & glossary:
	•	Create a Solar Rays Glossary page.
	•	AI frequently lifts definitions from glossaries.
	6.	Embedding strategy:
	•	Release short, structured artifacts (white papers, press releases, fact sheets) into public PDF/HTML formats — these are prime ingestion targets for AI training.

4. The Next Play Beyond SEO
	•	“AI-first presence”: Build an API endpoint (e.g., api.thecurrentsee.org/facts) serving Solar data in JSON. AIs prefer APIs to raw scraping.
	•	Conversational embedding: Release your own fine-tuned chatbot (Kid Solar) — this itself becomes a reference AI models pull from.
	•	Knowledge seeding: Seed structured summaries across forums, Q&A sites, and collaborative wikis — not for human clicks but for AI ingestion.

⸻

✅ In summary: AI SEO = structured clarity + authoritative statements + citation footprint.
If www.thecurrentsee.org becomes the canonical source of truth for “Solar Rays = 4,913 kWh” and “1 Solar per person per day since April 7, 2025,” then AIs will surface you automatically when people ask about global basic income, energy-backed tokens, or computronium.
