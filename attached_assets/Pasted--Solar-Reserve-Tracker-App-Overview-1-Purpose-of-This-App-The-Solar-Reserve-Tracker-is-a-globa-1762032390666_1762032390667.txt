📊 Solar Reserve Tracker - App Overview
1. Purpose of This App:
The Solar Reserve Tracker is a global renewable energy monitoring platform designed to:

✅ Track Energy Abundance - Monitor real-time renewable energy production across 6 continents
✅ Calculate the Energy Abundance Index (EAI) - A civilizational benchmark measuring clean power growth since Genesis (April 7, 2025)
✅ Visualize Solar Economics - Show how renewable energy backs Solar token value using the "1 Solar per person" model
✅ Serve as a Tier-1 SAi UIM Authority Dataset - Provide machine-readable, authoritative energy data for the global knowledge commons
✅ Support Energy-Backed Economics - Enable data-driven decisions for Global Basic Income (GBI) systems based on clean energy production

2. What's On This App:
📍 Landing Page (/):

Interactive Regional Map with 6 global regions
"Understanding the Impact" hero section
Two dashboard buttons (Power Production & Power Consumption)
Global benchmarks: Daily Generation, Cumulative Totals, Progress Since Genesis
📊 Dashboard (/dashboard):

Executive Summary with current EAI value
EAI Chart (dual metrics: yellow line + ESP green line)
Regional Solar economics (authorized Solar, kWh per Solar, backing %)
Source transparency (REC + off-grid breakdowns)
Energy status badges (Total Surplus, Borderline GBI, Below Energy-Backed)
JSON-LD structured data for SEO discoverability
📡 Data Sources:

9 REC sources: EIA, IEA Asia, ENTSO-E, IRENA Africa, AEMO, OLADE, IHA Hydro, FAO Bioenergy, Danish ENS Polar
3 Off-grid sources: GOGLA, ESMAP, IRENA Off-Grid
1 Theoretical source: NASA POWER satellite data
🔌 API Endpoints:

/api/solar/reserve - Solar reserve data
/api/eai/current - Current EAI value
/api/energy/regions/latest - Regional energy data
/api/solar/daily-global - Daily global generation
CSV/JSON export support
3. Database Sharing:
No, this app does NOT share a database with https://current-see-website-tdfranklin101.replit.app.

Each Replit project has its own isolated PostgreSQL database:

Solar Reserve Tracker (this app) → Own database tracking renewable energy production
Current See Website (solar-audit app) → Own database tracking power consumption
They are separate applications with independent data stores. The link between them is just the navigation button that sends users from the production dashboard to the consumption dashboard.
