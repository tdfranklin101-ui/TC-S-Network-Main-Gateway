Solar Conversion and Monetization Algorithm

At the core of the Current-See system is a conversion algorithm that turns solar energy into monetary value.

Key Assumptions:
- Total solar energy reaching Earth: ~174 Petawatts per day
- Monetized portion: 1%
- Global population: 8.5 billion
- Target daily income per person: $136,000 (interest on $1 billion annually)

Calculation Logic:
1% of 174 Petawatts = 1.74 Petawatts = 1.74e+17 watts/day
Converted to kilowatt-hours (kWh): 1.74e+17 W / 1000 * 24h = 4.176e+15 kWh/day

Divide by population: ~491 million kWh/person/day

From this, each "Solar" token represents one person's share of the monetized solar input.

Using this daily issuance as the basis, the algorithm also splits a portion into reserves and operations. Any unused Solar accrues, creating long-term wealth.

This approach ensures scalability, fairness, and non-inflationary supply.
