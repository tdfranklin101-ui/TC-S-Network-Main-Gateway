The Problem and Vision

The world is at an inflection point. Humanity faces a dual crisis of climate change and unequal energy access. Despite the rise of solar and wind, global emissions continue to climb, fossil fuels still dominate, and traditional markets have not sufficiently rewarded clean energy contribution.

Solar energy is now the cheapest form of electricity across most of the planet. And yet, economic structures and incentive models have lagged behind. Subsidies for fossil fuels still outweigh those for renewables, and access to energy - let alone participation in its production - remains limited in much of the world.

The Current-See proposes a bold response: A solar-backed currency (Solar), powered by blockchain, distributed through a real-time ledger, and guided by a situationally aware AI wallet. The idea is to reward people not for extracting resources, but for contributing to sustainability.

This white paper introduces the foundational vision - to transform energy into a distributable asset, generate value based on daily global solar input, and launch a new economic model where energy is not only a necessity but a dividend.

The Current-See PBC, Inc. is a public benefit corporation committed to creating the infrastructure, digital tools, and global economic protocols necessary for this system to function. From token issuance to equitable distribution, we outline here why a new model is essential - and how the Solar token can help us get there.

This document establishes the philosophical and operational groundwork upon which the remaining white papers build:
- White Paper #2: The Current-See Solution and Technology Stack
- White Paper #3: Situationally Aware AI Wallet
- White Paper #4: Solar Conversion and Monetization Algorithm
- White Paper #5: The TC-S Network

Together, these papers describe a globally scalable system, beginning with the recognition of Earth's solar income as our shared inheritance - and the means to distribute it fairly, daily, and digitally.
