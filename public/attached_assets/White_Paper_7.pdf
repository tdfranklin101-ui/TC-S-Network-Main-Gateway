White Paper: The Private Current-See Network Implementation

The Current-See PBC, Inc. Solar Briefings Series White Paper #7 

4.16.2025

Preface

While The Current See PBC, Inc. is steadfast in its mission to launch a global basic income network, we recognize the importance of demonstrating the functionality and scalability of our technology in real-world settings. To this end, we are leveraging our proprietary Token Currency System (TC-S) Network to implement private currency networks. These deployments serve dual purposes: validating our system's efficacy across diverse user groups and generating funding to further develop our global initiative.



1. Introduction

The evolution of digital economies necessitates innovative solutions that empower organizations to create bespoke financial ecosystems. The Private Current-See Network offers a customizable platform enabling entities to establish their own branded currencies and transactional infrastructures, fostering economic resilience and community engagement.



2. The TC-S Network: An Overview

The Token Currency System (TC-S) Network is a modular, scalable platform designed to facilitate the creation and management of private digital currencies. Key features include:

Branded Digital Currencies: Organizations can design currencies that reflect their brand identity and values.

AI-Driven Wallet Applications: Customizable wallet apps equipped with AI capabilities for seamless transactions and user engagement.

Secure Ledger Systems: Robust, transparent ledgers ensuring transactional integrity and compliance.

Gamification Elements: Incorporation of reward systems to incentivize participation and loyalty.



3. Licensing and Transactional Framework

3.1 Licensing Model

Under the Corporate Model, The Current See PBC, Inc. licenses the TC-S Network technology to clients, providing:

Customized Currency Creation: Tools to develop and manage branded digital currencies.

Branded AI Wallet Deployment: Tailored wallet applications for user transactions within the private network.

Infrastructure Support: Access to the TC-S Network's secure and scalable infrastructure.

Licensing fees are structured based on user group size and anticipated transaction volumes, ensuring scalability and accessibility for organizations of varying sizes.

3.2 Transactional Licensing

In addition to the base licensing fee, a Transactional License model is employed, wherein The Current See PBC, Inc. receives a nominal fee per transaction conducted within the private currency network. This model aligns the interests of both parties, incentivizing the continuous improvement and expansion of the network.



4. Use Cases

4.1 Corporate Environments

Companies can implement private currencies to enhance employee engagement, reward systems, and internal marketplaces. For instance, a corporation might introduce a branded currency to reward employees for wellness activities, professional development, or peer recognition, redeemable within the company's ecosystem.

4.2 Events and Venues

Large-scale events, such as music festivals or conferences, can utilize private currencies to streamline transactions, reduce reliance on cash, and enhance attendee experiences. For example, a festival could issue tokens for food, merchandise, and services, facilitating quick and secure transactions.

4.3 Community Initiatives

Non-profit organizations and local communities can adopt private currencies to stimulate local economies, encourage volunteerism, and distribute resources effectively. A community might issue tokens to volunteers, redeemable at local businesses, thereby promoting civic engagement and supporting local enterprises.



5. Regulatory Compliance

Even though The Current-See is not legal tender, we may need to operate within the digital currency space that necessitate adherence to regulatory standards. The Current See PBC, Inc. ensures compliance by:

Registering as a Money Services Business (MSB): Aligning with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) requirements.

Obtaining Necessary State Licenses: Securing licenses such as the New York BitLicense for operations within specific jurisdictions. 

Implementing AML and KYC Protocols: Establishing robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures to maintain the integrity of the network.



6. Funding the Global Basic Income Network

Revenue generated through the licensing and transactional models of the Private Current-See Network directly supports the development of the global basic income initiative. By demonstrating the system's scalability and effectiveness across various applications, we aim to attract further investment and partnerships to realize our overarching mission.



7. Conclusion

The Private Current-See Network represents a strategic approach to validating and funding the broader vision of a global basic income system. Through customizable, secure, and compliant private currency networks, The Current See PBC, Inc. empowers organizations to innovate within their financial ecosystems while contributing to a more equitable global economy.
