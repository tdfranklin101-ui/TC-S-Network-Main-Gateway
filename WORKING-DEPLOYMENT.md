# WORKING DEPLOYMENT READY

## Status: SERVER CONFIRMED WORKING
✅ Health check: `{"status":"healthy","service":"Current-See Working Server"}`
✅ Port 3000 active
✅ Multimodal endpoint ready
✅ File upload configured

## Deployment Files Ready
- `working-main.js` - Tested working server
- `public/index.html` - Multimodal interface (from ultra-lite)
- All dependencies available

## What Works
- Photo upload interface
- Kid Solar multimodal response (simplified for testing)
- File size and type detection
- Error handling
- Health monitoring

## Deployment Strategy
1. Use `working-main.js` as main server file
2. Ensure `public/index.html` exists with upload interface
3. Deploy with minimal dependencies (express, multer)
4. Test multimodal button functionality immediately

## Expected Result
- Fast deployment (server already tested working)
- Immediate access to photo upload button
- Kid Solar response confirmation
- Proof multimodal functionality works
