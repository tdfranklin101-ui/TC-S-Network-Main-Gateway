    The Billionaire Surplus: Unlocking Discretionary
                    Abundance for All
White Paper No. 6 in the Solar Briefings Series
Issued by The Current-See PBC, Inc.
April 2025



Executive Summary
The Current-See system introduces a new economic logic: one not based on scarcity, but on the
abundant, daily, equitable input of solar energy. At the core of this new model is a simple question:
What happens when every human receives more value than they can spend each day—measured not
in fiat currency, but in energy? The answer: We create a planet of billionaires.



I. The Solar Standard
The foundational unit of The Current-See system is the Solar—a digital unit of value representing a
share of Earth's daily solar energy income. We have defined: 1 Solar = 4,913 kilowatt-hours (kWh); 1
Solar = $136,000 symbolic value (based on 1% monetization of Earth's daily solar inflow). This value
anchors the Solar not to markets or scarcity, but to the physics of energy abundance—updated and
distributed globally, daily.



II. What Does the Average Person Consume?
To determine how much of this Solar value is actually needed by an individual to live a modern,
comfortable life, we analyzed the average per capita daily energy consumption:

Electricity (direct use): ~30 kWh
Transportation (fuel eq.): ~40 kWh
Food production footprint: ~15 kWh
Goods & services lifecycle: ~45 kWh
Total: ~130 kWh/day



III. The Surplus Calculation
If every individual is issued 1 Solar/day (4,913 kWh) and only 130 kWh/day is used, the surplus is
substantial:
Used value (130 kWh): 130 ÷ 4,913 ≈ 2.65% of 1 Solar = ~$3,597/day
Surplus value: $136,000 - $3,597 ≈ $132,403/day in unused discretionary value



IV. The Billionaire Threshold
What is a billionaire? In The Current-See framework, wealth is defined by access, not accumulation. If
you receive more value each day than you can meaningfully consume, you are living at the threshold of
post-scarcity: functional billionairism.
V. Implications for Global Equity
This surplus logic dismantles the foundational myth of scarcity economics. In its place, it offers: a
non-inflationary global stipend based on solar energy inflow; a reversible, transparent ledger of usage
and storage; a network of equitable abundance, where excess value is not hoarded, but stored, shared,
or repurposed.



VI. From Surplus to Civilization Upgrade
Imagine what happens when 8.5 billion people: have their needs met with 2.65% of their energy
budget; retain 97.35% of their daily Solar as discretionary capital; and contribute excess to planetary
infrastructure, innovation, and restoration.



VII. Next Steps
This paper is both a declaration and an invitation. We are: issuing Solar to early registrants; tracking
usage vs. surplus; building the wallet and recommendation engine for real-world impact.
