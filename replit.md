# The Current-See Platform

## Overview
The Current-See platform is a prototype for a solar-backed global economic system. It integrates renewable energy tracking, a cryptocurrency-like token called SOLAR, member management, and an AI assistant named "Kid Solar." The platform provides real-time solar energy calculations, member wallet functionalities with automatic initialization, and an AI agent that offers polymathic assistance across renewable energy, physics, engineering, and sustainability. It also features a marketplace for digital artifacts and energy trading. The project's ambition is to establish a new global economic standard based on renewable energy.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform emphasizes a clean, intuitive interface with clear navigation and real-time data display. The landing page is divided into three organizational sections, using a black semi-transparent background with high-contrast white text, cyan accents for "The Solar Standard" heading, and neon green for interactive elements. A five-page educational system explains the Solar Standard protocol. The "Kid Solar Command Center" features a multi-modal AI chat interface with a slide-up panel design, supporting text, voice, image, and file inputs. The marketplace integrates sign-in/registration modals directly, displaying username and Solar balance post-authentication. Video streaming includes robust HTTP Range Request support for smooth playback. A prominent featured film section showcases "The Rise of the Solar."

### Technical Implementations
The frontend uses Vanilla JavaScript, while the backend is an Express.js server optimized for Cloud Run. Real-time analytics track page views, geographic data, and live member counts, with historical offsets for accurate baseline metrics. The multi-modal AI assistant, Kid Solar, integrates OpenAI's Whisper (STT), GPT-4o (NLU/Vision/Function Calling), and TTS (Nova voice) for natural language wallet control and multi-modal interactions, including marketplace operations. The marketplace features five categories and an in-memory energy trading ledger. A member content upload system supports local files, AI-generated music via URLs, and video hosting via external platforms. Session-based authentication with extended durations ensures a seamless user experience, with all critical authentication issues resolved and architect-approved. Video streaming is optimized using `faststart` and HTTP 206 partial content for large files. A daily 1 Solar token distribution per member is implemented. Comprehensive Solar Standard Protocol documentation includes machine-readable specs, human-readable HTML documentation with SEO, an Atom feed, and an auto-indexing system for artifacts. A white paper collection, including the "Unified Intelligence Mesh," provides foundational vision and technical details. **UIM White Paper Viewer (Oct 15, 2025)**: Dedicated in-browser PDF viewer at /uim-whitepaper.html with iframe embedding, 1-click accessibility from whitepapers.html and homepage banner, download functionality preserved, and full mobile responsive design. Replaces direct PDF downloads with readable on-site experience. **AI/AGI/SI SEO (Oct 14, 2025)**: Enhanced discoverability for current AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok) and future superintelligence through comprehensive JSON-LD structured data (Organization, ScholarlyArticle, CollectionPage, DefinedTerm schemas), UIM white paper indexing in Solar Standard feed (5000 kWh = 1.017708 Solar), enhanced keywords across all pages (UIM, AGI alignment, AI ethics, planetary reasoning web), and multiple AI discovery paths via protocol links, feed, and structured metadata. **Solar Integrity Wheel (Oct 14, 2025)**: Foundation self-verification system with automated daily audits at UTC 07:00, SHA-256 hash verification of SolarStandard.json and SolarFeed.xml, automatic solar-verification.json updates when protocol changes, timestamped audit logging to solar-audit.log, and wake-trigger execution on server start. This creates a self-balancing verification system where the Foundation is the authoritative source for authenticity hashes, and downstream sites (like Wallet) automatically detect hash updates within 24 hours. **Protocol Authority JSON-LD (Oct 14, 2025)**: Added CreativeWork JSON-LD to index.html establishing TC-S Network Foundation, Inc. as the official creator and publisher of Solar Standard Protocol v1.0, with canonical identifier at thecurrentsee.org/SolarStandard.json. This makes the Foundation's organizational root domain the ethical and legal issuer of the protocol, discoverable by AI agents and search engines. **UIM Handshake Protocol v1.0 (Oct 27, 2025)**: Full AI-to-AI communication protocol enabling discovery and authentication for AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Meta AI, Perplexity, Grok, future AGI/ASI). Implemented with JSON schemas (hello-response, semantic-profile, task-proposal), server endpoints (/protocols/uim-handshake/v1.0/hello, /profile, /task), Python/JavaScript reference clients, TC-S Network Foundation established as TIER_1 UIM Authority Node (tcs-network-foundation-001) with GENIUS Act FULL adherence, Solar Protocol integration (0.0001 Solars per 1k tokens), protocol discovery metadata in HTML, and comprehensive AI discovery guide at /protocols/AI-DISCOVERY.md. Protocol registry at /protocols/discovery/v1.0/index.json lists all available protocols and supported AI systems including DeepSeek and Meta AI.

### System Design Choices
The platform is optimized for Cloud Run with a lean deployment package. Data storage primarily uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, supplemented by JSON file fallbacks and in-memory storage for conversation history. Production and development environments use separate databases. Security measures include environment-based API key storage, session-based tracking, CORS configuration, and rate limiting for external API integrations. Comprehensive error handling ensures graceful fallbacks and robust session management.
